## Overview

Agents are specialized AI assistants that can be configured with specific instructions, tools, and behaviors. They enable you to create focused, reusable AI workflows tailored to particular tasks or domains.

## What Are Agents?

Think of agents as expert assistants with:
- **Custom instructions**: Define how the agent should behave and respond
- **Specific tools**: Select which applications and APIs the agent can access
- **Consistent behavior**: Agents follow the same instructions every time
- **Shareable knowledge**: Make agents available across your organization

## Key Features

### Custom Instructions
Define exactly how your agent should operate:
- Personality and tone
- Domain expertise
- Response format
- Decision-making guidelines

### Tool Selection
Control which capabilities your agent has:
- Select specific applications
- Choose individual API operations
- Configure MCP servers access
- Set tool usage policies

### Visibility Control
Manage who can use your agents:
- **Private**: Only visible to you
- **Public**: Available to your entire organization
- Easy visibility toggle

### Version Control
Track changes and improvements:
- Edit instructions over time
- Update tool configurations
- Maintain agent consistency

## Creating an Agent

### Step 1: Navigate to Agents

1. Click **Agents** in the main navigation
2. Click the **+ New Agent** card
3. You'll see the agent creation form

### Step 2: Configure Basic Information

**Agent Name**
- Choose a descriptive name
- Examples: "GitHub Bot", "Customer Support Assistant", "Data Analyzer"
- Keep it short and memorable

**Agent Description** (Optional)
- Explain the agent's purpose
- Describe what it's good at
- Helps team members understand when to use it

### Step 3: Write Instructions

This is where you define your agent's behavior. Good instructions include:

**Role Definition**
```
You are an expert GitHub repository manager who helps developers with code reviews and issue management.
```

**Capabilities**
```
You can:
- Create and update GitHub issues
- Review pull requests
- Search code repositories
- Manage project boards
```

**Guidelines**
```
When responding:
- Be concise and technical
- Always include relevant GitHub links
- Use markdown formatting
- Provide code examples when helpful
```

**Example Complete Instructions**
```
You are a customer support agent specializing in technical troubleshooting.

Your role is to:
1. Understand customer issues clearly
2. Search the knowledge base for solutions
3. Create support tickets for unresolved issues
4. Follow up with customers promptly

Guidelines:
- Always be polite and empathetic
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Provide step-by-step solutions
- Escalate complex issues to human agents
- Use bullet points for clarity

When creating tickets:
- Include all relevant customer information
- Tag with appropriate priority level
- Add reproduction steps if provided
```

### Step 4: Select Tools

Choose which applications and tools your agent can access:

**Default Toolkit**
- Enable to give access to all configured applications
- Good for general-purpose agents
- Simpler to manage

**Custom Tool Selection**
- Select specific applications only
- More precise control
- Better for specialized agents

**MCP Servers**
- Choose which MCP servers to enable
- Control access to specific capabilities
- Configure per-agent permissions

### Step 5: Set Visibility

**Private Agent**
- Only you can see and use it
- Perfect for personal workflows
- Test agents before sharing

**Public Agent**
- Available to your entire organization
- Appears in everyone's agent list
- Great for team collaboration

### Step 6: Save and Test

1. Click **Save** to create your agent
2. Test it immediately in a new chat
3. Mention the agent using `@agent_name`
4. Refine instructions based on results

## Using Agents

### In Copilot

Invoke agents in your conversations:

**Direct Mention**
```
@GitHub Bot please create an issue for the login bug
```

**Implicit Usage**
The agent's instructions guide the conversation context and behavior.

### Agent Context

When you use an agent:
- Its instructions are added to the conversation
- Only specified tools are available
- The agent's personality shapes responses
- All mentions from instructions are inherited

## Managing Agents

### Viewing Agents

The Agents page shows two sections:

**My Agents**
- Agents you created
- Private agents
- Full control to edit or delete

**Shared Agents**
- Public agents from your organization
- Created by team members
- View-only access

### Editing Agents

1. Find your agent in "My Agents"
2. Click the **Edit** icon
3. Modify instructions, tools, or settings
4. Click **Save Changes**

Changes take effect immediately in new conversations.

### Deleting Agents

1. Find your agent in "My Agents"
2. Click the **Delete** icon
3. Confirm the deletion
4. The agent is permanently removed

**Note**: Existing conversations using the agent will continue to work.

### Changing Visibility

Toggle between private and public:
1. Find your agent in the list
2. Click the visibility icon
3. Confirm the change
4. The agent moves to the appropriate section

## Agent Best Practices

### Writing Effective Instructions

**Be Specific**
- ❌ "Help users with GitHub"
- ✅ "You are a GitHub automation assistant that creates issues, manages pull requests, and updates project boards based on user requests"

**Define Boundaries**
```
You can:
- Create and update issues
- Comment on pull requests
- Search repositories

You cannot:
- Delete repositories
- Modify security settings
- Access private repositories without permission
```

**Include Examples**
```
Example interaction:
User: "Create an issue for the login bug"
You: "I'll create a GitHub issue. What should the title be?"
User: "Login fails with special characters"
You: *creates issue with title, asks for description*
```

### Tool Selection Strategy

**Specialized Agents**
- Select only necessary applications
- Reduces confusion and errors
- Improves response accuracy
- Example: GitHub-only agent for code management

**General Purpose Agents**
- Use default toolkit
- Enable multiple applications
- Good for exploratory workflows
- Example: Research assistant with web search, docs, and email

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names:
- **Good**: "Jira Issue Creator", "Slack Notifier", "Data Export Assistant"
- **Avoid**: "Agent1", "My Agent", "Test"

Include the domain or platform in the name when relevant.
