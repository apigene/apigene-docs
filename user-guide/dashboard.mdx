- Increasing error trends

### Usage Patterns

**Normal Patterns**
- Weekday activity, weekend quiet
- Aligned with business hours
- Consistent per-user usage
- Predictable application mix

**Unusual Patterns**
- Weekend/night spikes (investigate)
- Sudden usage drops (issues?)

## Taking Action Based on Insights

### High Error Rates

**Steps to Take**
1. Navigate to Actions page
2. Filter by error status codes
3. Review failed requests
4. Common fixes:
   - Update expired credentials
   - Fix parameter formats
   - Adjust rate limiting
   - Contact API provider for 5xx errors

### Low Usage

**Possible Reasons**
- Users don't know about features
- Integration not meeting needs
- Complex setup or usage
- Better alternatives available

**Actions**
