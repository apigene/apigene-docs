## Overview

Actions are the individual API calls that Copilot executes on your behalf. The Actions page provides a comprehensive log of all API interactions, allowing you to monitor, debug, and analyze your application usage.

## What Are Actions?

Every time Copilot interacts with an application, it creates an action record that includes:
- **Request details**: What was sent to the API
- **Response data**: What the API returned
- **Performance metrics**: How long the call took
- **Status information**: Success or failure
- **User context**: Who initiated the action

## Accessing Actions

Navigate to **Actions** from the main navigation menu to view all your API call history.

## Action List View
