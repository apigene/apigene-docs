## Overview

Context items are reusable pieces of information that you can reference in your Copilot conversations. They provide consistent data, instructions, or knowledge that the AI can use across multiple interactions, reducing repetition and ensuring accuracy.

## What Is Context?

Context items are stored pieces of information that can include:
- **Reference data**: Company information, product details, guidelines
- **Code snippets**: Reusable code templates or examples
- **Documentation**: Technical specs, API documentation, procedures
- **Instructions**: Standard operating procedures, policies
- **Templates**: Message templates, response formats
- **Knowledge**: Domain expertise, best practices, FAQs

## Why Use Context?

### Consistency
- Same information used across all conversations
- No need to repeat common details
- Reduced errors from manual entry

### Efficiency
- Reference complex information with simple mentions
- Avoid copying and pasting repeatedly
- Faster conversation setup

### Knowledge Sharing
- Share context across your organization
- Onboard new team members faster
- Centralize important information

### AI Enhancement
- Provide domain-specific knowledge
- Improve AI response accuracy
- Guide AI behavior consistently

## Creating Context Items

### Step 1: Navigate to Context

1. Click **Context** in the main navigation
2. Click **+ New Context** button
3. The context creation form appears

### Step 2: Configure Basic Information

**Context Name**
- Choose a descriptive, memorable name
- Use clear naming conventions
- Examples: "company-info", "api-guidelines", "brand-voice"

**Context Description** (Optional)
- Explain what the context contains
- Note when to use it
- Helpful for team members

### Step 3: Add Content

**Content Field**
- Enter your context information
- Can include:
  - Plain text
  - Markdown formatting
  - Code snippets
  - JSON data
  - XML/YAML
  - Documentation excerpts

**Content Examples**

**Company Information**
```markdown
# Company Information

Company Name: Acme Corporation
Founded: 2020
Industry: Software Development
Main Product: AI-powered automation tools

Contact Information:
- Support Email: support@acme.com
- Sales Email: sales@acme.com
- Phone: +1-555-0123

Office Locations:
- HQ: San Francisco, CA
- Europe: London, UK
- Asia: Singapore
```

**API Guidelines**
```markdown
# API Integration Guidelines

Authentication:
- Always use OAuth 2.0
- Refresh tokens before expiry
- Store tokens securely

Error Handling:
- Retry on 5xx errors with exponential backoff
- Log all 4xx errors for analysis
- Show user-friendly error messages

Rate Limiting:
- Maximum 100 requests per minute
- Implement request queuing
- Monitor usage via dashboard
```

**Code Template**
```python
# Standard API Request Template

import requests
from typing import Dict, Any

def make_api_request(
    endpoint: str,
    method: str = "GET",
    headers: Dict[str, str] = None,
    data: Dict[str, Any] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Standard API request handler with error handling.
    """
    try:
        response = requests.request(
            method=method,
            url=f"{BASE_URL}/{endpoint}",
            headers=headers,
            json=data,
            timeout=30
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"API request failed: {e}")
        raise
```

### Step 4: Set Metadata

**Context Type**
- Select the appropriate type
- Helps with organization and filtering
- Examples: documentation, code, template, policy

**Tags** (Optional)
- Add searchable tags
- Group related contexts
- Examples: "api", "customer-support", "development"

### Step 5: Set Visibility

**Private Context**
- Only you can see and use it
- Perfect for personal references
- Test before sharing

**Public Context**
- Available to your entire organization
- Appears in everyone's context list
- Great for team standards

### Step 6: Save

1. Click **Save** to create the context item
2. It's immediately available for use
3. Reference it with `@context-name` in Copilot

## Using Context Items

### In Copilot Conversations

Reference context items using mentions:

**Simple Reference**
```
@company-info please draft an email to a new client
```

**Multiple Context Items**
```
Using @api-guidelines and @code-template, create a new 
API integration
```

**Implicit Usage**
```
Following our standard practices, create a support ticket
(if agent has context item in instructions)
```

### How Context Is Applied

When you mention a context item:
1. The AI receives the full context content
2. It uses this information to inform responses
3. It maintains consistency with the guidelines
4. It references specific details as needed

### Context in Agents

Agents can include context mentions in their instructions:

```
You are a customer support agent.

Always reference @company-policies and @support-templates 
when responding to customers.

Use @faq-database to answer common questions before 
escalating.
```

This ensures the agent always has access to this information.

## Managing Context Items

### Viewing Context

The Context page shows:

**My Contexts**
- Context items you created
- Private items
- Full edit/delete access

**Shared Contexts**
- Public items from your organization
- Created by team members
- View-only access

### Searching Context

Use the search bar to find context items:
- Search by name
- Search by description
- Search by tags
- Filter in real-time

### Editing Context

1. Find your context in "My Contexts"
2. Click the **Edit** button
3. Modify name, content, or settings
4. Click **Save Changes**

**Changes Apply**
- Immediately to new conversations
- Existing conversations may have old version
- Update agents that reference this context

### Deleting Context

1. Find your context in "My Contexts"
2. Click the **Delete** button
3. Confirm deletion
4. Context is permanently removed

**Impact**
- No longer available for new mentions
- Agents referencing it may show warnings
- Existing conversations with it continue to work

### Changing Visibility

Toggle between private and public:
1. Click the visibility toggle
2. Confirm the change
3. Context moves to appropriate section
4. Available to others immediately

## Context Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

**Use Clear Names**
- ✅ "customer-support-guidelines"
- ✅ "api-authentication-process"
- ✅ "brand-voice-standards"
- ❌ "context1"
- ❌ "my-stuff"
- ❌ "temp"

**Follow Patterns**
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Include domain or purpose
- Keep names concise but descriptive
- Consistent with team conventions

### Content Organization

**Keep It Focused**
- One purpose per context item
- Break large contexts into smaller ones
- Example: Instead of "all-company-info", create:
  - "company-details"
  - "contact-information"
  - "office-locations"

**Structure for Clarity**
```markdown

- Code blocks for snippets
- Lists for easier scanning
- Headers for organization

### Maintenance

**Regular Review**
- Monthly review of all contexts
- Update outdated information
- Remove unused contexts
- Consolidate duplicates

**Version Control**
- Note major changes in descriptions
- Keep change log if critical
- Communicate updates to team
- Test changes before saving
