## Authentication Methods

The MCP Gateway supports two authentication methods:

### OAuth Authentication (Recommended for User Applications)

Use OAuth when you need user-specific access:
- Automatically handled by your MCP client
- User context is maintained
- Actions are tracked per user
- No additional configuration needed

### API Key Authentication (For Server Integrations)

Use API keys for automated systems:
- Include `apigene-api-key` header in requests
- Direct server-to-server access
- No user context required
- Ideal for automated workflows

## How to Choose

**Use OAuth when:**
- Building user-facing applications
- Need to track actions per user
- Want automatic token management

**Use API key when:**
- Building server-to-server integrations
- Running automated systems
- Don't need user context
