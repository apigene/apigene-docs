## What is the MCP Gateway?

The Apigene MCP Gateway enables AI assistants and chatbots to interact with your Apigene applications through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Connect tools like Claude Desktop, Cline, or any MCP-compatible client to discover and execute actions across your integrated applications.

## Key Capabilities

### Discover Applications and Actions
- Browse all available applications in your agent
- Search for specific actions by description or type
- Get detailed action schemas and parameters

### Execute Actions
- Run single actions with full parameter control
- Execute the same action multiple times in parallel (batch mode)
- Run different actions simultaneously across multiple apps

### Manage Context (Agent Mode)
- Access agent instructions and capabilities
- List and search available contexts
- Create new contexts to extend agent knowledge

## Two Operation Modes

### MCP Mode
Basic action execution for simple integrations:
- List and search actions
- Execute actions across applications
- Perfect for straightforward API interactions

### Agent Mode
Full agent capabilities with enhanced features:
- Access agent instructions
- Context management
- Application discovery
- Complete agent workflow support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- An Apigene account with configured applications
- An MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cline, etc.)
- Your application identifier (`genai_app`)

### Connection Steps

1. **Get Your Endpoint**
   - MCP Mode: `/{type}/mcp/{genai_app}/mcp`
   - Agent Mode: `/{type}/agent/{genai_app}/mcp`

2. **Configure Authentication**
   - Use OAuth for user-based access
   - Or use API key for server-to-server access

3. **Connect Your Client**
   - Add the gateway URL to your MCP client configuration
   - Initialize the connection
   - Start using tools and resources

## What You Can Do

### For AI Assistants
Connect your AI assistant to execute real actions across your applications:
- "Send a message in Slack"
- "Create a Jira issue"
- "Get my latest emails from Gmail"

### For Developers
Build integrations that can discover and use Apigene capabilities:
- Dynamic action discovery
- Flexible execution patterns
- Standard MCP protocol compliance
