# Introduction

Apigene copilot is designed to **transform how users interact with workplace applications**. By leveraging **natural language interfaces** and **AI-driven workflows**, it eliminates the need for switching between apps, reduces operational friction, and enhances productivity.

With deep integrations, task orchestration, personal and organizational context awareness, and enterprise-grade governance, our copilot empowers teams to automate, interact, and analyze across systems – all within a unified experience.

---

## ✨ Key Capabilities Overview

---

### 1. 🧑‍💻 Conversational Interface

#### Description

The primary user experience is built around a **copilot-style chat interface**. Users can interact with connected applications by simply typing requests in natural language. The system uses `@mention` syntax to bring specific apps into context.

#### Features

- **@mention Integration** – Use `@` to invoke any connected application.
- **Contextual Conversations** – Follow-up questions can refer to previous responses.
- **Cross-App Commands** – Chain actions across apps (e.g., retrieve data from Ashby and post results to Slack).
- **Zero-switching UX** – All actions occur within a single interface.

#### Example Use Case

1. `@Ashby list all candidates`
2. `Select top 3 for frontend engineering`
3. `@Slack send shortlist to #hiring-managers`

### 2. ⚙️ AI-Driven Tasks

#### Description

The task engine enables users to **create, save, and execute multi-step workflows** across systems using natural language.

#### Capabilities

- **Multi-Step Execution** – Combine multiple app calls into a single flow.
- **Data Aggregation** – Fetch, filter, and group data from structured sources.
- **AI-Powered Logic** – Use AI to interpret data and make decisions (e.g., select most relevant candidates).
- **Visualization** – Automatically generate charts (e.g., pie charts) based on task outputs.

#### Example Task

> "List all expenses from Expensify, group by category, and display in a pie chart."

#### Scheduled Tasks

- Mark a task as **agentic** to make it run repeatedly.
- Useful for daily reports, weekly syncs, or hourly monitoring.

#### Task Attributes

- **Category** – E.g., Finance, HR, Support
- **Scope** – Private, Public, or Team-specific
- **Scheduling** – One-time or recurring

---

### 3. 🗂 Task Management System

#### Description

A dedicated UI enables users and admins to manage tasks efficiently.

#### UI Features

- **Natural Language Editor** – Express complex logic without coding.
- **Task Library** – View and reuse saved tasks.
- **Sharing Controls** – Define who can view, edit, or run tasks.
- **Policy Enforcement** – Ensure consistent task behavior across departments.

#### Collaboration Features

- Task sharing across team members.
- Version control and history logs.
- Public vs. Private visibility settings.

## 🛡️ Security, Governance & Monitoring

---

### 7. 🔐 Fine-Grained Application Controls

#### Admin Capabilities
