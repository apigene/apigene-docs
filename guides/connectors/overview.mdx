AI connectors are used to connect Apigene AI applications to AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.

An AI  connector can be created for a single AI application, or for multiple applications combining to achieve a specific goal. 

After an AI connector has been created, you can connect it to an AI assistant in two ways.

1. Via an OpenAPI Spec - Apigene provides an OpenAPI spec for each AI connector that can be used to connect it to an AI assistant. This is useful for connecting to OpenAI GPT applications. You can learn how to connect to a GPT application [here](/guides/connectors/connect-gpt-application).
2. Via an MCP connection. The second way to attach your AI connector to an AI assistant is with an MCP connection. There are two types of MCP connections - MCP remote connection and MCP local connection. For more information on how to setup an MCP connection, see [Connect to an MCP client](/guides/connectors/connect-mcp-client).
