AI connectors are used to connect Apigene AI applications to AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.

An AI  connector can be created for a single AI application, or for multiple applications combining to achieve a specific goal. 

After an AI connector has been created, you can connect it to an AI assistant in two ways.


1. Via an OpenAPI Spec - Apigene provides an OpenAPI spec for each AI connector that can be used to connect it to an AI assistant. The OpenAPI Spec can also be used to create a GPT application on the OpenAI GPT store. You can learn how to set up a GPT application using an Apigene AI connector OpenAPI Spec [here](guides/connectors/create-gpt-application).
2. Via an MCP connection. The second way to attach your AI connector to an AI assistant is with an MCP connection. There are two types of MCP connections - MCP remote connection and MCP local connection. For more information on how to setup your MCP connection, see [Connect to an MCP client](guides/connectors/connect-mcp-client).
