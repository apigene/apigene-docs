Through our API, you can build white label applications that let users interact with their favorite applications from their AI assistants.

### What is an AI application
An AI application is a business application that has been installed on Apigene. 

After converting a business application to an AI application, you can interact with the application using our AI copilot, or create AI connectors and interact with the application using AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.

#### Create a new AI application

Business applications are converted to AI applications by installing their OpenAPI specification file on Apigene. 

You can do this by uploading the SPEC file `YAML` or `JSON` file, or by importing the SPEC file from the URL of the OpenAPI specification url.

Follow the instructions [here](/guides/add-ai-application) to set up your first AI application.

### Interact with your AI application

There are two ways to interact with your AI application. 

- Apigene Copilot - Interact with your application using the Apigene copilot.
- AI Connectors - Convert your API application to an AI connector and connect it to AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.

### AI connectors
To connect your AI applications to AI assistants like ChatGPT or Claude, you need to create an AI connector for the apps. 

Apigene AI connectors allow for two modes of connection to AI assistants.

- Connection via Spec files - This is used for Open AI GPT applications.
- MCP Connection via MCP local or MCP remote

Learn more about AI connectors [here](/guides/connectors/overview).
