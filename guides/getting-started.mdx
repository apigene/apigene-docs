Apigene is a secure bridge for connecting your business applications to AI assistants.

### What is an AI application
An AI application is a business application that has been installed on Apigene. 

After converting a business application to an AI application, you can interact with the application using our AI copilot, or create AI connectors and interact with the application using AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.

#### Create a new AI application

Business applications are converted to AI applications on Apigene using their OpenAPI specification. 

You can do this by uploading the API SPEC file `YAML` or `JSON` file, or by importing the SPEC file from a OpenAPI url.

Follow the instructions [here](/guides/add-ai-application) to set up your first AI application.

### Interact with your AI application

There are two ways to interact with your AI application. 

- [Apigene Copilot](/guides/getting-started#apigene-copilot) - Interact with your application using the Apigene copilot.
- [AI Connectors](/guides/getting-started#ai-connectors) - Convert your API application to an AI connector and connect it to AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.

#### Apigene Copilot

The Apigene copilot is designed to **transform how you interact with your workplace applications**.

By leveraging **natural language interfaces** and **AI-driven workflows**, the Apigene copilot eliminates the need for switching between apps, reduces operational friction, and enhances productivity.

You can learn more about the Apigene copilot [here](/guides/copilot/copilot).

#### AI connectors

To connect your AI applications to AI assistants like ChatGPT or Claude, you need to create an AI connector for the apps. 

Apigene AI connectors allow for two modes of connection to AI assistants.

- Connection via Spec files - This is used for Open AI GPT applications.
- MCP Connection via MCP local or MCP remote

You can learn more about AI connectors [here](/guides/connectors/overview).
