The **Actions** page provides a comprehensive view of all user-initiated activities across your connected applications. The page allows you to monitor, search, and analyze every action performed, including user inputs, API responses, status codes, and more. 

The page is an essential tool for auditing, debugging, and understanding how users interact with your APIs and automations.

To access the **Actions** page.

1. Access your [Apigene](https://app.apigene.ai) account
2. Navigate to **Actions** to access the page

The page has three sections:

1. [Action Log Table](/guides/admin/actions#action-log-table)
2. [Search bar](/guides/admin/actions#search-bar)
3. [Action Details Panel](/guides/admin/actions#action-details-panel)

The table displays the following data:

- `User ID`: The identifier of the user who performed the action
- `Application`: The name of the connected app or API
- `User Input`: The input or command provided by the user
- `Created At`: Timestamp of when the action was performed
- `Duration`: How long the action took to complete
- `Status Code`: HTTP status code returned by the API
- `Response Length`: Size of the API response

<Note>

- Pagination Controls: Choose how many actions to display per page (10, 25, or 50) and navigate between pages.
