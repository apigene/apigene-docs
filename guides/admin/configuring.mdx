# Overview

Apigene makes it easy to connect, secure, and manage APIs for your organization. This guide walks you through the process of adding a new API, configuring security, setting access controls, managing server URLs, and adding common parameters.

---

## 1. Adding a New API

You can add a new API to Apigene in two ways:

### **A. Install from File**
- Click the **New App** button in the API management page.
- Choose the option to upload an OpenAPI/Swagger file from your computer.
- Select your file and proceed. Apigene will parse the file and extract all available endpoints and metadata.

### **B. Install from URL**
- Click the **New App** button.
- Choose the option to provide a URL.
- Enter the URL to a publicly accessible OpenAPI/Swagger specification.
- Apigene will fetch and parse the API definition automatically.

After installation, you will be guided through a step-by-step configuration wizard.

## 2. General API Configuration

### **API Name, Version, and Domain**
- The API name and version are auto-filled from the specification and are read-only.
- You can edit the domain to reflect the business or technical domain of the API.

### **Summary**
- Optionally, provide or edit a summary to describe the API’s purpose for your team.

### **Server URL**
- Set the base URL where the API is hosted (e.g., `https://api.example.com/v1`).
- You can select from suggested URLs (if available) or enter a custom one.
- **Validation:** The URL must start with `http://` or `https://`. Invalid URLs will be flagged, and you must correct them before proceeding.

## 3. Adding Security Tokens

### **Security Info Editor**
- In the **Security** section, you can configure how Apigene authenticates with the API.
- Supported security schemes include:
  - **API Key** (in header, query, or cookie)
  - **Bearer Token** (e.g., OAuth2, JWT)
  - **Basic Auth**
  - **Custom Headers**
- For each scheme, specify:
  - The parameter name (e.g., `Authorization`, `X-API-Key`)
  - The value or token (you can use environment variables for sensitive data)
  - Where the token should be sent (header, query, etc.)
- You can add multiple security schemes if the API supports them.

**Tip:** Keep your tokens secure. Use environment variables or Apigene’s secret management features if available.

## 4. Setting Operation Access Control

### **Operation Access Control Panel**
- After general configuration, proceed to the **Operation Access Control** step.
- Here, you can:
  - **Enable/Disable** specific API operations (endpoints) for your organization.
  - Set **access permissions** for each operation (e.g., restrict to certain user roles or teams).
  - View and filter operations by HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), tags, or path.
  - See a description and schema for each operation to understand its purpose and requirements.

**How to use:**
- Use the checkboxes to enable or disable operations.
- Use dropdowns or chips to assign access roles or tags.
- Click on an operation to view its detailed schema and parameters.

---

## 5. Adding Common Parameters

- In the configuration steps, you can define **common parameters** that should be included in every request to the API.
- Examples: organization ID, locale, or any custom header/query parameter.
- Specify the parameter name, value, and where it should be injected (header, query, etc.).
- These parameters will be automatically included in all API calls made through Apigene.

---

## 6. Finalizing and Saving

- After completing all configuration steps, review your settings.
- Click **Finish** or **Save** to apply the configuration.
- Apigene will reindex the API and make it available for use in automations, tasks, and the API playground.

---

## 7. Best Practices

- **Keep security tokens up to date** and rotate them regularly.
- **Restrict access** to sensitive operations using the access control panel.
- **Test your API** in the Apigene playground before using it in production workflows.
- **Document** any custom parameters or security requirements for your team.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

- If your API does not appear after installation, check the server URL and security settings.
- For authentication errors, verify that your tokens and credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions.
- If you encounter issues with specific operations, review their schemas and required parameters in the access control panel.

By following these steps, you can securely and efficiently integrate any API into Apigene, control access, and ensure your team has the tools they need to build powerful automations.
