The **Context** feature in Apigene allows users to personalize their experience and tailor the behavior of the Apigene Co-pilot to their individual preferences, role, and working style.

By providing information such as your name, position, desired AI traits, and additional personalization fields, you help Apigene deliver more relevant, context-aware, and effective assistance.


You can use the context feature to implement the following capabilities:

- **Personalized Greetings**: The Co-pilot addresses you by your chosen name.
- **Role-Aware Suggestions**: Recommendations and automations are tailored to your position (e.g., a "Developer" may get more technical suggestions).
- **Custom AI Behavior**: If you specify "formality: high" and "clarity: essential", the Co-pilot will use a more formal and clear communication style.
- **Team or Project Context**: Add fields like "Project: Apollo" or "Team: Data Science" to help Apigene contextualize your queries and tasks.


You can perform the following Context actions from the Apigene dashboard.

- [Create Context](/guides/copilot/context#create-context) - Create new application context
- [Edit Context](/guides/copilot/context#edit-context) - Modify existing context
