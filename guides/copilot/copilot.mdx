The Apigene copilot is designed to **transform how you interact with your workplace applications**. 

By leveraging **natural language interfaces** and **AI-driven workflows**, the Apigene copilot eliminates the need for switching between apps, reduces operational friction, and enhances productivity.

With deep integrations, task orchestration, personal and organizational context awareness, and enterprise-grade governance, our copilot empowers teams to automate, interact, and analyze across systems – all within a unified experience.

## Key Capabilities

### Conversational Interface

The primary user experience is built around a **copilot-style chat interface**. 

You can interact with connected applications by simply typing requests in natural language. The system uses `@mention` syntax to bring specific apps into context.

#### Features

Key features of the conversational interface include -

- **@mention Integration** – Use `@` to invoke any connected application.
- **Contextual Conversations** – Follow-up questions can refer to previous responses.
- **Cross-App Commands** – Chain actions across apps (e.g., retrieve data from Ashby and post results to Slack).
- **Zero-switching UX** – All actions occur within a single interface.

#### Example Use Case

1. `@Ashby list all candidates`
2. `Select top 3 for frontend engineering`
3. `@Slack send shortlist to #hiring-managers`

### AI-Driven Tasks

The Apigene copilot has an AI-driven task engine that enables you to **create, save, and execute multi-step workflows** across your systems using natural language.

You can learn more about Apigene Tasks [here](/guides/copilot/task).

#### Features

Key features of the Task engine include -

- **Multi-Step Execution** – Combine multiple app calls into a single flow.
- **Data Aggregation** – Fetch, filter, and group data from structured sources.
- **AI-Powered Logic** – Use AI to interpret data and make decisions (e.g., select most relevant candidates).
- **Visualization** – Automatically generate charts (e.g., pie charts) based on task outputs.

#### Example Tasks

> "List all expenses from Expensify, group by category, and display in a pie chart."

##### Scheduled Tasks

- Mark a task as **agentic** to make it run repeatedly.
- Useful for daily reports, weekly syncs, or hourly monitoring.

##### Task Attributes

- **Category** – E.g., Finance, HR, Support
- **Scope** – Private, Public, or Team-specific
- **Scheduling** – One-time or recurring

You can also create **visual insights from task outputs**.

You can automatically generate:

  - Pie Charts
  - Bar Graphs

  - Tables with sorting & filtering

And embed visualizations into:

  - Dashboards
  - Slack/Teams posts
  - Email digests

### Context Injection System

Apigene lets you inject two types of context to your copilot.

1. [Organizational Context](/guides/copilot/copilot#organizational-context)
2. [Personal Context](/guides/copilot/copilot#personal-context)


#### Organizational Context

The organizational context feature lets you define rules, KPIs, and business constraints that modify your copilot's behavior during runtime.

##### Example Context Use Cases

- "When querying Salesforce, prioritize accounts tagged 'high-value'."
- "Flag violations if expense \> \$5,000 and no approval found."

##### Configuration

- Context rules are assigned per application.
- Supports YAML/JSON-based config or via UI wizard.
- Can be versioned and audited.


#### Personal Context

You can enrich the copilot with personal preferences or goals.

##### Benefits

- Personalized responses.
- Smart defaults in task execution.
- Role-based behavioral tuning.

##### Examples

- Time zone preferences
- Reporting styles
- Email formatting defaults

### Security, Governance & Monitoring

The Apigene copilot lets you define Fine-Grained Application Controls policies to determine how the copilot interacts with your organization's data.

#### Admin Capabilities

- Define which operations are **allowed, restricted, or hidden**.
- Customize behavior per role (e.g., Analyst, Manager, Admin).
- Disable sensitive API endpoints from being exposed.

#### Example Policy

> Allow HR team to access candidate listings, but restrict job offer generation.


#### Audit Trail & Monitoring

Every request, response, and action with the Apigene copilot is logged. This enables investigation, compliance checks, and rollback.

You can also view your usage metrics in a dashboard. You can view the following data -

- **Usage Breakdown**:
  - By user
  - By app
  - By task
  - By time period
- **Task Success Rate**
- **API Latency Reports**
- **Security Alerts**


##### Export Options

- Export logs as CSV, JSON, or stream to SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk, Datadog).

#### Role-Based Governance

You can manage your application's access at a organization, team, and user level. Your copilot interactions governed by organizational compliance rules, and task visibility scoped by roles.
